## Project : deducing locations while walking - NAAGA

### Project Introduction
NAAGA is a game where players deduce the location they need to reach based on pictures of places and directional hints of north, south, east, and west. Users deduce the locations while walking. Throughout the game, users can drop pins (notes) containing messages at their current locations.

## What I did in project
1. Application of Spatial Data and Spatial Index
- Improving query performance
  - Crafting queries using spatial data and spatial functions
  - Applying a spatial index
- Establishing an integrated testing environment using a test container

  [Issue Situation]
  - When executing a query to find places within a specified distance based on location information,
  - Calculating the distance using latitude and longitude information of each place from the database every time leads to performance issues, especially with a large amount of data.  
  - H2 does not support spatial functions.
  - Testing is being conducted in an environment different from the production environment.

  [Resolution Steps]
  - As spatial indexes deal with spatial data, converted latitude and longitude from the existing DECIMAL data type to POINT data.
  - Configured a spatial index for the POINT column to efficiently handle spatial data.
  - Used the 'ST_DISTANCE_SPHERE' function to calculate the distance between two points.
  - Utilized a test container to create an independent MySQL execution environment and conducted integrated testing similar to the actual production server environment.
  - Leveraging spatial data and a spatial index resulted in a performance improvement from a query execution time of 0.03 seconds to 0.005 seconds, achieving a six-fold speed enhancement.

2. N+1 Troubleshooting
- Resolving N+1 issue through Fetch Join
- Resolving '@Transactional' LazyInitializationException error

  [Issue Situation]
  - Encountered N+1 problems while using JPA.

  [Resolution Steps]
  - Resolved the N+1 issue by using Fetch Join, but faced a 'LazyInitializationException' error in the test code.
  - The error occurred when trying to load lazily associated values after calling the service method and closing the persistence context, as there was no connection to the database.
  - Thus, resolved the problem by attaching the '@Transactional' annotation to the respective test code to encapsulate within the scope of a single transaction.

3. Introduction of CloudFront and S3
- Resolving image file caching and storage capacity issues
  - Unlimited storage capacity provided by S3
  - Static file caching feature of CloudFront
- Strengthening EC2 server security
  - Path-based routing using CloudFront

  [Issue Situation]
  - Due to the use of Docker, when requests for storing image files come in,
  - Issues arise with host server capacity when a large number of image files are stored.
  - Additionally, there were problems with slow network speeds when serving cached image files in response to image file retrieval requests.

  [Resolution Steps]
  - Image files were stored in S3, which offers unlimited storage, to prevent capacity issues on the EC2 server.
  - CDN like CloudFront caches the image files stored in S3 in edge locations, allowing users to load cached images from edge locations for faster download speeds.
  - Leveraging CloudFront's caching functionality reduced content download time from 2.26ms to 0.67ms.
  - Additionally, by directing requests to S3 and EC2 based on the requested URL path, we reinforced EC2 security.

4. Establishment of CI/CD Pipeline and Continuous Deployment
- Utilizing GithubActions and Docker Hub for version control, we established a CI/CD pipeline.

  [Issue Situation]
  - There were issues with communication between the Docker container's application and MySQL.
  - When the infrastructure server (Self-Hosted Runner) executed shell scripts of the production server, there was a problem reading the docker-compose file.
  - During deployment, there were instances of temporary service downtime.

  [Resolution Steps]
  - As Docker containers have their own network stack, MySQL needs to allow the IP address used by the Docker container.
  - Therefore, allowing all network connections for MySql resolved the network isolation issue.
  - When servers executing shell scripts were different from the infrastructure server, the location of execution of shell scripts led to the docker-compose file being unread.
  - Therefore, specifying the absolute path of the docker-compose file in the shell script resolved the issue.

  - Considering various deployment strategies:
    - Rolling deployment, which sequentially updates versions on multiple servers, wasn't appropriate for a single server.
    - Canary deployment, for gradually updating versions to a small number of users, wasn't selected as the service doesn't cater to a large number of users to distribute traffic.
    - Hence, we opted for Blue-Green deployment, which doesn't require consideration for lower server version compatibility.
  - Resolved downtime issues by directing traffic to newly updated Docker containers using Nginx's reverse proxy configuration.

5. Resolution of Concurrent History Registration Issue for Pins with Messages

  [Issue Situation]
  - When storing the history of read notes, a concurrency problem occurred where quickly reading the same note twice resulted in multiple instances of the note being marked as read.

  [Resolution Steps]
  - Applied a unique constraint to the column of the respective database table to allow the storage of a specific note's read history only once, thus resolving the issue.

6. Contribution to Resolving Concurrent Likes Issue(Collaborative testing, comparative analysis of alternatives)
  [Issue Situation]
  - When multiple users pressed the 'like' button simultaneously, using JPA's change detection for updating the 'like' count resulted in data loss due to transaction conflicts (Lost Update).

  [Resolution Steps]
  - Introduced optimistic locking and retry logic to solve the concurrency problem. However, there was an issue where if 500 requests came in simultaneously, all but one request had to retry.
  - Considered using update queries to address concurrency problems. However, this method held X-locks longer compared to using optimistic locking and had the issue of including domain logic in queries.
  - Given that incrementing 'like' counts is a lightweight operation, even when using pessimistic locking, the time maintaining X-locks was found to be very short at 0.03 seconds.
  - Ironically, due to the retry logic with optimistic locking, the performance degradation caused by optimistic locking was greater than that caused by pessimistic locking.
  - Decided to resolve the concurrency issue using pessimistic locking via Update queries. However, there was a problem with the repository's query including domain logic for +1 operations.
  - Therefore, resolved the concurrency issue of 'like' counts by using Select For Update to fetch 'like' counts and utilizing JPA's change detection.
